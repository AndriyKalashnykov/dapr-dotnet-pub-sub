# Dapr DotNet pub/sub

In this quickstart, you'll create a publisher microservice and a subscriber microservice to demonstrate how Dapr enables
a publish-subcribe pattern. The publisher will generate messages of a specific topic, while subscribers will listen for
messages of specific topics.
See [Why Pub-Sub](https://docs.dapr.io/developing-applications/building-blocks/pubsub/pubsub-overview/) to understand
when this pattern might be a good choice for your software architecture.

Visit [this](https://docs.dapr.io/developing-applications/building-blocks/pubsub/) link for more information about Dapr
and Pub-Sub.

> **Note:** This example leverages the Dapr client SDK. If you are looking for the example using only
> HTTP [click here](../http).

This quickstart includes one publisher:

- Dotnet client message generator `producer`

And one subscriber:

- Dotnet subscriber `consumer`

## Run all apps with multi-app run template file:

This section shows how to run both applications at once
using [multi-app run template files](https://docs.dapr.io/developing-applications/local-development/multi-app-dapr-run/multi-app-overview/)
with `dapr run -f .`. This enables to you test the interactions between multiple applications.

1. Open a new terminal window and run Kafka:

```bash
make runk
```


2. Open a new terminal window consumer and producer:

```bash
make run
```

3. Send a message to the producer app:
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:5231/send -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"id": "e9cdd036-c529-4bf9-bd59-d7148ef9237d", "timeStamp": "2025-09-26T02:52:04.835Z"}'
```

The terminal console output should look similar to this:

```text
== APP - producer == info: Microsoft.AspNetCore.Hosting.Diagnostics[1]
== APP - producer ==       Request starting HTTP/1.1 POST http://localhost:5231/send - application/json 67
== APP - producer == Received request body: {

== APP - producer ==     "timeStamp": "{{$datetime iso8601}}"

...
```

4. Stop and clean up application processes and Kafka

```bash
make stop
make stopk
```

## Run a single app at a time with Dapr (Optional)

An alternative to running all or multiple applications at once is to run single apps one-at-a-time using multiple
`dapr run .. -- dotnet run` commands. This next section covers how to do this.

### Run Dotnet message subscriber with Dapr

1. Run the Dotnet subscriber app with Dapr:

```bash
cd ./consumer
dapr run --app-id consumer --app-port 5230 --components-path ../components dotnet run
```

### Run Dotnet message publisher with Dapr

1. Run the Dotnet publisher app with Dapr:

```bash
cd ./producer
dapr run --app-id producer --app-port 5231 --components-path ../components dotnet run
```

2. Stop and clean up application processes

```bash
dapr stop --app-id consumer
dapr stop --app-id producer
```
